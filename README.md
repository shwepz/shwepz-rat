## What Sets Shwepz Rat Apart

Shwepz Rat stands out from the crowd for several reasons:

- **Live Microphone**: Enjoy real-time audio surveillance with Shwepz Rat, which provides a live microphone feature.

- **Socks5 Reverse Proxy**: Shwepz Rat includes a Socks5 reverse proxy, allowing you to bypass network restrictions and access remote systems with ease.

- **Regular Updates and Much More**: We are committed to keeping Shwepz Rat up to date and continually improving its features and functionality to better meet your needs.

- **Built Completely from Scratch**: Shwepz Rat is developed entirely from scratch, ensuring a unique and tailored approach to remote access tools.
